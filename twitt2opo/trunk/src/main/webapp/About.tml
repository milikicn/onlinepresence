	The 
		<a href="http://online-presence.net/" target="_blank">OPO (Online Presence 
		Ontology)</a> is an ontology which aims to model the dynamic aspects of a user's 
		presence online and to enable exchange of the <b>Online Presence data</b>. The domain 
		where OPO can make a significant contribution is the exchange of user's statuses 
		on various Instant Messengers. OPO provides a flexible model for representing the 
		semantics of online statuses thus making their descriptions precise and understandable 
		for the platforms exchanging them.
